The date is #{date}
The time is #{time}

All that is gold does not #{1},
Not all those who wander are #{2};
The old that is strong does not #{3},
Deep roots are not reached by the #{4}.
From the ashes a fire shall be #{5},
A light from the shadows shall #{6};
Renewed shall be blade that was #{7},
The crownless again shall be #{8}.
